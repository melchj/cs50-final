# cs50 final project
a project to satisfy cs50's final assignment.

## commute tracker/visualizer
---
i hate driving to/from work.

the goal of this project is to provide a tool that can give info about how awful someones drive to/from work is at certain times of day.


### where does the data come from?
---
 - google takeout

therefore, it this will only really work for those who use google maps a lot and have a lot of data to export from google.

### who is this for?
---
(aside from the cs50 autograder bot)

anyone who has location data in their google takeout and would like some insights on their commuting time.


### eventual features
---
the type of data that i would eventually like this tool to provide:
 - average drive time per
   - day of week
   - week
   - month
 - visualizations of the above (graphs? heatmaps?)
 - total count of time wasted commuting
   - comparisons to other useful things that time could be spent doing
 - ??? more to come
